# BST
My implementation of a Binary Search Tree in Java.

This is implemented with a interface, so that features can be added at a later time.

If there are any features you want me to add, let me know and I can see if I have time to implement it.

## How to run

Download/Clone the repo and enter the src folder and type

```
$ javac *.java && java BSTMain.java
```

in your terminal window and the main file will start some "tests" to make sure all features are working correctly.

The *src* folder contains the source file.
